# The Gruyere Target
Gruyere is a Codelab by Bruce Leban, Mugdha Bendre, and Parisa Tabriz. Gauntlt vendors it here to have a target to run gauntlt attacks against.  We assume no responsibility for the code and we are not distributing the code in a modified form.

It is a vulnerable app and should not be copied or modified.

# To run Gruyere
```
$ ./launch.sh
```
You should now be able to go to http://localhost:8008

# To stop Gruyere
```
$ ./kill.sh
```
That's it.  You can make sure that it isnt running `ps -ef | grep python` in case you are worried.
