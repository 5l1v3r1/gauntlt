Feature: Run httprint scan on a URL

Scenario: Use httprint to scan Gruyere

  Given "httprint" is installed
  And the following profile:
    | name          | value                 |
    | host          | 127.0.0.1:8008        |  
  When I launch a "httprint" attack with:
    """
    httprint -h <host> -s /usr/share/httprint/signatures.txt
    """
  Then the output should contain:
    """
    Banner Reported: BaseHTTP/0.3 Python/2.7.12+
    """
