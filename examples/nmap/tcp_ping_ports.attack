Feature: nmap attacks for example.com
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the target hostname is "google.com"
    And the target tcp_ping_ports are "22,25,80,443"

  @slow
  Scenario: Using tcp syn ping scan and the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F -PS<tcp_ping_ports> <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      80/tcp
      """
