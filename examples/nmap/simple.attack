Feature: simple nmap attack (sanity check)

  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name     | value      |
      | hostname | google.com |

  Scenario: Verify server is available on standard web ports
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p 80,443 <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      80/tcp  open  http
      443/tcp open  https
      """
