Feature: Run garmr scan on a URL

Scenario: Use Garmr to scan a website for basic security requirements
  Given "sqlmap" is installed
  And the target URL is "http://localhost:9292/inline-js"
  When I launch a "sqlmap" attack with:
    """
    garmr -u <target_url>
    """
  Then the output should contain:
    """
    [Garmr.corechecks.InlineJS] Fail Inline JavaScript found
    """
