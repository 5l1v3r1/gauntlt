Feature: Run sqlmap against a target

Scenario: Identify SQL injection vulnerabilities
  Given "sqlmap" is installed
  And scapegoat is running on port 9292
  And the target URL is "http://localhost:9292/sql-injection?number_id=1"
  When I launch a "sqlmap" attack with:
    """
      python <sqlmap_path> -u <target_url> --dbms sqlite
    """
  Then the output should not contain:
    """
    [CRITICAL]
    """
  And scapegoat should quit
